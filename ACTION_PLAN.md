# Action Plan: Fix NGO Dashboard Campaigns

## Your Current Situation
You can log in as an NGO user, but your campaigns don't appear in the dashboard.

## Root Cause
Your campaigns have `NULL` in the `ngo_user_id` column, so when the dashboard queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM campaigns WHERE ngo_user_id = 'your-ngo-id'
```
It returns zero results.

---

## Step 1: Quick Fix (Do This Now - 3 Minutes)

### 1.1 Get Your NGO User ID
Open your browser console (F12) on the NGO dashboard and find this line:
```
NGO User ID: abc-123-def-456-...
```
**Copy that ID!**

### 1.2 Run SQL Fix
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Open the file: **`COMPLETE_FIX_NGO_CAMPAIGNS.sql`**
3. Run **Step 1** queries to see current state
4. Run **Step 2** to see your NGO user ID
5. Choose **METHOD 1** (recommended) and customize it:
   ```sql
   -- First verify your NGO user
   SELECT id, email, org_name FROM ngo_users WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';

   -- Then link all campaigns
   UPDATE campaigns
   SET ngo_user_id = (
     SELECT id FROM ngo_users WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com'
   )
   WHERE ngo_user_id IS NULL;
   ```
6. Run **Step 3** to verify it worked
7. **Refresh your NGO dashboard** - campaigns should appear!

**Detailed instructions:** See [COMPLETE_FIX_NGO_CAMPAIGNS.sql](COMPLETE_FIX_NGO_CAMPAIGNS.sql)

## Step 2: Update NGO Dashboard Code (Do This After Step 1)

The current NGO dashboard has limited functionality. Replace it with the complete version:

1. Open: **`COMPLETE_NGO_DASHBOARD_CODE.txt`**
2. Copy all the code
3. Paste it into: **`app/ngo/dashboard/page.jsx`**
4. Save the file

**This adds:**
- ✅ Full CRUD for Needed Items
- ✅ Full CRUD for Updates/Posts
- ✅ NGO name displayed in header
- ✅ Proper statistics calculation
- ✅ Better error handling

## Step 3: Prevent Future Issues (Do This Week)

### Update Campaign Creation
Find where campaigns are created (likely `app/ngo/campaigns/create/page.jsx`) and ensure it always sets `ngo_user_id`:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .insert({
    title: campaignTitle,
    description: campaignDescription,
    ngo_user_id: ngoInfo.id,  // ← CRITICAL! Always set this
    ngo: ngoInfo.org_name,
    // ... other fields
  })
```

## Step 4: Long-Term Architecture (Next Sprint)

### Consider Adding User Roles

**Your Question:** "Should I add user roles to Supabase Authentication?"

**Answer:** YES, ABSOLUTELY!

Currently you have two separate authentication systems:
- **Donors:** Supabase Auth (`auth.users`)
- **NGOs:** Custom cookie auth (`ngo_users` table)

This creates:
- ❌ Two auth systems to maintain
- ❌ Duplicate code
- ❌ Confusion about which user table to use
- ❌ Hard to add new user types (admin, moderator)
- ❌ Issues like campaigns not linking properly

**Recommended Solution:**
Unify to Supabase Auth with a `role` field in user profiles.

## Need Help?

If campaigns still don't show after Step 1:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, org_name FROM ngo_users;
   SELECT id, title, ngo_user_id FROM campaigns;
   ```
3. Share the results

## Summary

✅ **Problem identified:** campaigns.ngo_user_id is NULL
✅ **Solution ready:** SQL script to link campaigns
✅ **Code ready:** Complete dashboard with all features
✅ **Architecture advice:** Migrate to unified auth with roles

**Next Action:** Open `COMPLETE_FIX_NGO_CAMPAIGNS.sql` and run Step 1-3 in Supabase SQL Editor!
